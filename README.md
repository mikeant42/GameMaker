# GameMaker
This is a partial rewrite of the EnterpriseEngine in C++. Hopes that it will be slimmer, and more effecient. In addition, the engine will also support skeletal animation, and physically based rendering (pbr) that the EnterpriseEngine did not.

## General TODOs
- Need a good logging library, shouldn't be using `cout` so often
- Should I be using a namespace?
- Improve Shader SetUniform() function, shouldn't be five different ones
